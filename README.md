# CS4850-Chatroom

Assignment for CS4850 - Computer Networks 1
Coursework done at The University of Missouri - Columbia

Assignment Description:

In this project, you will implement a simple chat room that includes a client and a server that
utilizes the socket API. The socket API is implemented in many programming languages. You
are permitted to use your language of choice as long as it utilizes the socket API.
The client program provides commands: login (allow users to join the chat room), newuser
(create a new user account), send (send a message to other clients; actually send the message to
the server and the server forwards the message to other clients), and logout (quit the chat room).


This solution is a simple threaded command line chat application which utilizes sockets 

Compile and run server first then different clients can join once server is running.
